#[Phase 3 Guide to Final Projects](https://github.com/fence-lizards-2014/phase-3-guide/tree/master/final-project-directions)

## Project Workflow

1. We **REALLY** recommend that you use agile engineering practices.
  * Build features in vertical slices (from test to css).
  * Re-evaluate your user stories and project goals regularly - don't be afraid to pivot from the original idea (though don't pivot too often)
  * Develop team workflow agreements around git, deployment, testing, conflict resolution, lunch and other important items.
  	+ Ours is at: [git workflow](/git-workflow.md)


## What we want to provide

1.  Support for team leads (and team members!) to help keep interpersonal
conflict and friction at a minimum
1.  Tips in constructing and advancing your debugging process
1. Consultation :  We will be available to consult with your team.  Have questions ready for us. If you don't we will use those as free time to explore / mangle / flog yourcode.
