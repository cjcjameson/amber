# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global

# Ignore bundler config
/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*.log
/tmp

# Ignore our DB setup because it has username and password fields
# Check out our readme for how to create your own.
