# Final Project Workflow

This is where you document how your team will work.  Spend time up front deciding these things as a team, and refer back to this document to help stay on track and resolve conflicts.  Fill out each section with your team decisions - feel free to use or replace the suggestions. Link this document to your repository README.md.

### Github workflow
  * We will have a staging branch used for combining feature branches to see if they play well together. This will be used before being merged into Master.
    * Pull requests to the staging branch need to be approved by any other team member.  If everything looks good, another team member is asked to verify before merging to master.
    * We will work on specifically named branches and commit often.
